# Deveel SMPP


## Short Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol

Short _Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP)_ in the telecommunications industry is an open, industry standard protocol designed to provide a flexible data communication interface for the transfer of short message data between _External Short Messaging Entities (ESMEs)_, _Routing Entities (REs)_ and SMSC

## The Project

This project aims to provide a set of tools to support the protocol and the establishment of connections between entities and the reaction to the events within the open connections.

The driver for this project is the consideration of the lack of proper interest for this matter in the .NET development ecosystem, probably because of the niche nature of the consumers of the protocol.
